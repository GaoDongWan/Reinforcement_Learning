# Reinforcement_Learning

This repo implements some single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms with tf_2 and tensorlayer.

These implementations contains some instructions about the algorithms and can run on Google Colab.

Suggest to read .ipynb on Colab, because it cannot display some information such as some formulas perfectly in github.
